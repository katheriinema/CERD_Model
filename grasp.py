compare_grasp_state.py

This script loads 3D hand keypoints (saved as .npy files from HaMeR) and object point clouds
(saved as .ply files from Grounded-SAM2) and then computes a simple grasp state, but only for
matching timestamps. Finally, it sorts the results in ascending timestamp order.

File naming assumptions:
- Hand file names look like: "pour_water_02_1740349023.000_0_hand_3d.npy"
  --> We'll parse out the 4th underscore-delimited part as the timestamp (index=3).
- Object file names look like: "1740349023.000_1740349023.000_mask_0.ply"
  --> We'll parse out the 1st underscore-delimited part as the timestamp (index=0).

For each handâ€“object pair whose timestamps match, we:
  1. Convert hand keypoints from meters -> millimeters (if needed).
  2. Compute the centroid of the 21 keypoints.
  3. Find the min distance from centroid to object point cloud (in mm).
  4. Decide if it's a "grasp" if min distance < DIST_THRESH.
  5. Accumulate these rows and sort them by ascending timestamp.

This ensures we only compare matching frames, and output is sequential by timestamp.
